This bot will automatically convert a timestamp in a message to different timezones. Timezones to convert to are configurable per channel, and the user sending the message must have a local timezone configured for it to activate.

# Usage
Create settings.json in the main directory as a copy of defaultsettings.json. Add your token and run ´´´python bot.py´´´
